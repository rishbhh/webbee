                        <p>WebBee Global has developed an information security incident response plan to implement its incident response policies procedures effectively. Incident response is that plan which brings together and organizes the resources for dealing with an event that harms or threatens the security of information assets. Such events may be malicious attacks, unauthorized use of services, a hoax, or unauthorized access to information or systems. Our main goal is to facilitate efficient response to incidents and limit their impact while protecting the information’s assets. The purpose of the incident response plan is to make incident response plan more simplistic and consistent for all potential types of incidents. The incident response phrases are:
